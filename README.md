## Getting Started

TLDR;
NashDevOps.com is a static site build using Jekyll and hosted via GitHub Pages. This Jekyll project utilizes Docker to deliver a consistent build and server environment to support development.

### Learn About Jekyll

See Documentation:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Jekyll - How it Works](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)

### Learn About GitHub Pages

See Documentation:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [GitHub Pages - Custom Domain](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)
- [GitHub Pages - Configure HTTPS](https://help.github.com/en/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https)

### Install Docker

See Documentation:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker - Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Pull the Official Jekyll Image

See Documentation:

- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- [Jekyll Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll)
- [Jekyll Docker Image - ReadMe](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker/blob/master/README.md)

Example:

    # Docker Pull Command
    docker pull jekyll/jekyll

    # Verify Docker Images
    docker images

### Clone the Repository

Example:

    # Git Clone Project
    git clone git@github.com:nashvilledevops/nashvilledevops.github.io.git

### Building the Project (via Docker)

The following commands will build the Jekyll Project using the Standard Official Docker Image (jekyll/jekyll) which includes a default set of "dev" packages, along with Node.js, and other stuff that makes Jekyll easy. It also includes a bunch of default gems that the community wishes us to maintain on the image.

Note: When you run the docker command below to build the project you will need to be at the root of the project directory as the present working directory (i.e. $PWD) is mounted as a volume within the running container.

Example:

    # Set the Jekyll Version
    export JEKYLL_VERSION=3.8.6

    # Run Docker to Build our Jekyll Project
    docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" -it jekyll/jekyll:$JEKYLL_VERSION jekyll build

### Serving the Project (via Docker)

The following commands will serve the Jekyll Project using the Standard Official Docker Image (jekyll/jekyll) at http://0.0.0.0:4000 

Note: When you run the docker command below to serve the project you will need to be at the root of the project directory as the present working directory (i.e. $PWD) is mounted as a volume within the running container.

Example:

    # Set the Jekyll Version
    export JEKYLL_VERSION=3.8.6

    # Run Docker to Serve our Jekyll Project
    docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" -p 4000:4000 -it jekyll/jekyll:$JEKYLL_VERSION jekyll serve

### Developing the Project (via Docker)

Once the docker container is running you can visit the site at http://0.0.0.0:4000 (see above) and can develop against the Jekyll Project locally and refresh your browser to see the changes.

### Jekyll Project Structure
